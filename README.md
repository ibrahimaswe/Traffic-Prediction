**Project description**

Our group tackled the challenge of predicting traffic patterns with machine learning to address the issue of widespread traffic congestion in large cities. We aimed to develop a traffic predictor capable of forecasting congestion levels and conditions at specific times. The broader goal was to give individuals a more informed decision on choosing routes to take and decrease congestion. Insights gained from this project was that certain models like linear regression can be used for time and date which is very important for our model.


**Running environments**
We utilized Jupyter Notebook to complete this project 

**Major results**
We examined and explored the traffic congestion dataset and chose one junction to train the two models. The RNN model performed poorly when we had 10 cell units and 10 epochs which led to an underfit model. After training with 30 units and 1000 epochs, the model fit became more suitable. The LSTM model with 70 units and 3000 epochs performed well but as it went further, it showed some underfitting. Overall the RNN model performed better with less units and epochs.
